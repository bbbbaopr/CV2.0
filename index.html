        <p><em>Web Developer and Student</em></p>
        <p>Current student, learning and applying web development everyday. I have a
          high level of enthusiasm for any endeavor I take on. Solving problems and
          developing skills is a continual process and I am here for it. Communication
          is extremely important in every aspect of life. Just like the code of a
          computer can understand certain languages, each human has their own way of
          viewing and communicating with the world. It is our job to communicate to
          understand. I am driven independently but I also believe that teamwork is
          important and enjoyable. Just like a machine, each part contributes to the bigger
          picture. Also, I love coffee and make my own kimchi. </p>
